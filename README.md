# S&P 500 Stock Price Prediction

## Project Overview

The script is structured to first obtain historical data of the S&P 500 index or its representative ETF (like SPY). It then employs a basic linear regression model as an example to demonstrate the concept of stock price prediction. The model predicts future prices based on historical price and volume data.

## Key Features

- **Data Handling**: The script includes functionality to load and preprocess S&P 500 index data.
- **Prediction Model**: A simple linear regression model is used for price prediction.
- **Backtesting**: The Zipline library is utilized for backtesting the prediction model against historical data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas: For data handling and preprocessing.
- Zipline: An open-source algorithmic trading library for backtesting.
- Scikit-learn: For implementing the linear regression model.

## Setup and Execution

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required Python libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install pandas zipline scikit-learn
   ```

2. **Data Preparation**:
   Ensure that the historical data for the S&P 500 index or its representative ETF is available and properly formatted.

3. **Running the Script**:
   Execute the script in a Python environment. This will run the prediction model and backtest it against the historical data.

## Customization

You can modify the script to test different prediction models or analyze different datasets. Adjust the model and preprocessing steps in the `trade_logic` function as needed.

## Disclaimer

This script is for educational and simulation purposes only. Predicting stock prices involves significant risk and can result in the loss of your invested capital. It is recommended to use this script alongside other market analysis tools and not as a sole decision-making tool.
